# Scientific Calculator

A simple yet modern **scientific calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic and scientific operations, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and square root functions.

## Features

* **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
* **Scientific Functions**: Trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), `log`, `sqrt`, and constants like `Ï€` and `e`
* **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
* **Interactive**: Designed to work with both mouse and keyboard inputs

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5**: For structuring the layout and elements
* **CSS3**: For styling and making the layout responsive
* **JavaScript**: For adding functionality and handling the operations
* **Visual Studio Code**: For development and live server testing
